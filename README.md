# At first I am really very very sorry for creating my own repository. I have some problem in the repository that provided by the programming hero team. At the beginning i push my code in that private repository, but when there is a problem with deployment, i tried to solve this problem by deleting the firebase file and mistakenly i deleted the src folder. I created another react project and create another repository. Please consider this. 

# Getting Started with my Ultra Riders Application.
This is my React project using Firebase Authentication. 
Here you can see several types of share rides. you can choose anything among them. 
When you click on the book now button it will take you on the Booking page if you are a logged in user otherwise it will take you on the login page. 
If you have an account with this application, then you can simply login. Otherwise you have to create an account. You can also sign in with facebook and google.
